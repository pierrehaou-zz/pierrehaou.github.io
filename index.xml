      <description>&amp;quot;Train tirelessly to defeat the greatest enemy, yourself, and to discover the greatest master, yourself&amp;quot;
 - Amituofo DeepMind has created AI that will crush any human player in Go, Chess, Shogi, and Starcraft 2.OpenAI has made similar strides in complex strategy games, notably in Dota 2. The agents in these games all achieved mastery using deep reinforcement learning. Yet, this is only part of the story. What was the magic sauce that sent these systems&#39; playing ability out of the atmosphere?</description>

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a subfield of reinforcement learning that is becoming increasingly relevant and has been blowing my mind (see gif and link above). It has found incredible success in popular strategy games and will be key to the continued advancement of several emerging technologies, communication between different autonomous vehicles being one such example.</description>
